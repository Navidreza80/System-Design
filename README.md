## Days 3-4: Database Systems
Learn: SQL vs NoSQL, Indexing, Sharding, Replication

Project: Model an E-commerce Database in both SQL and NoSQL

Output: GitHub repo with schema diagrams

## Day 5: Caching Strategies
Learn: Redis, CDNs, cache eviction policies

Project: Build a Node.js API with Redis cache

Output: Performance benchmarks comparing cached vs non-cached

## Day 6: Load Balancing & Networking
Learn: DNS, L4/L7 Load Balancing, Nginx, Reverse Proxies

Project: Configure Nginx as reverse proxy for a sample API

## Day 7: Mini Case Study
